## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
For the frontend, head to the frontend folder using your terminal and run `npm install` to install the dependencies
Then run `npm run dev` to start up the frontend port.

For the backend, head to the backend folder using your terminal and run `pipenv install` to install the required dependencies
Then run `pipenv shell` to start up the virtual environment, and then run the `app.py` file using either `python3 app.py` or `python app.py` (depending on the version of python you have installed). This should start your backend.
